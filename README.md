Werewolf Run:

In this game, you run through a dark forest at full speed as you attempt to run away from the dire wolves. There will be a lot of obstacles to stop you DEAD, including sloping grounds and grounds that fall.

The longer you run,the more points you earn.
Collect coins for extra perks like more score, coin magnet, super shield, slow time and many more.
Choose from an array of different looking characters.

This game is best suited for arcades like TIMEZone, etc.(Powerups and speed limits removed,10 coins give 1 ticket)

For more details, just play the game

(Since the game is in alpha state, these instructions do not make sense for now. Once I get time from college, I will continue development for this game.)
